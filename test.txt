called artificial neurons, which communicate with each other, form an artificial neural network [11, p. 15]. The artificial neuron, after receiving binary or floating-point input from one or more sources, multiplies and aggregates with weights. The resulting total is transferred to the activation function to be transmitted to the output. Figure 1 shows a schematic representation of an artificial neuron [9, p. 31]. The data obtained from the output layer of one artificial unit can feed the input layer of the other artificial unit. The inputs are represented like x1, x2, x3, ...xn as mathematical expressions [12]. The weights show how strongly the incoming data are transmitted to the output via the inputs. The mathematical expression of weights is shown as w1,w2,w3, . . .wn [13, p. 8]. The sum function produces net input by correlating each input value with the weights. The most commonly used addition function is the sum of each incoming input multiplied by its own weight. The mathematical form of the addition function is defined as [14]:
